      Welcome to Reviewo, my personal book review platform. I created this webapp to document and share my thoughts on books I've read, particularly those I delved into during the start of the year 2023. This project is also a practical exercise for me in developing React web applications. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any suggestions or comments.
